# Introduction {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

As of `r format(Sys.time(), '%d-%m-%Y')`, there have more than
1,133,000 cases of COVID-19 across the world, with more than 62,000
deaths [@whositrep]. In this report, we use the reported number of deaths
due to COVID-19 to make short-term forecasts of the trajectory of the
epidemic and the expected number of
COVID-19 deaths for 42 countries with sustained human-to-human
transmission. We also analyse reporting trends over time in each
country and estimate case ascertainment. 

Note that we produce forecasts for *reported* deaths in each
country. Further, in
countries with relatively few number of deaths, the forecasts may be
unreliable. The quality of forecasts will vary with the quality of
surveillance and reporting in each country.

## Executive Summary 


```{r child = "executive_summary.Rmd"}
```

## Detailed Summary

### Objectives and caveats

The **main** objective in this report is to produce forecasts of the 
number of deaths in the week ahead for each country with active
transmission.


* We define a country as having active transmission if
at least *ten* deaths were observed in the country in each of the past
two weeks. In the analysis for week beginning 
29-03-2020, 22 countries/regions were included in the
analysis. For the week beginning 05-04-2020,
the number of countries/regions included based on these thresholds is 42.


* We forecast the number of potential deaths as the reporting of deaths
is likely to be more reliable and stable over time than the reporting 
of cases. 

* As we are forecasting deaths, the latest estimates of
transmissibility reflect the epidemiological situation at the time of
the infection of COVID-19 fatalities. Therefore, the impact of
controls on estimated transmissibility will be quantifiable with a
delay between transmission and death.


A **secondary** objective of this report is to analyse case
ascertainment per country. As well as forecasting ahead, we use the number
of reported deaths and of cases reported with a delay (delay from reporting to deaths,
see Case Ascertainment method) to analyse the reporting trends per
country. If the reporting of cases and deaths were perfect, and
the delay between reporting and death is known, the ratio of
deaths to delayed cases would equal the Case Fatality Ratio (CFR).

In this analysis, key assumptions are:

* The mean underlying CFR is 1.38% (95% Credible Interval (1.23 - 1.53)) [@verity2020],
* The delay from a case being reported to death follows a gamma distribution with mean 10 days, and standard deviation 2 days.
* All deaths due to COVID-19 have been reported in each country.

## Methods

We define a country to have active transmission if
at least ten deaths were observed in the country in the last two
consecutive weeks. We intend to produce forecasts every
week, for the week ahead. Ensemble forecasts are produced from the
outputs of three different models.

Our main analysis assumes a gamma distributed serial interval with mean 6.48 days
and standard deviation of 3.83 days following [@wang2020strongly].
The serial interval estimates observed from various studies thus far
may be biased toward lower values due to observation bias whereby, in
contact tracing studies, long serial
intervals tend to be under-represented. To account for this, as a
sensitivity analysis, we also use a
shorter serial interval of mean 4.80 days and standard deviation of
2.70 days [@ferguson2020report]. Results using this shorter interval
are presented in the section Sensitivity Analyses. While using  a
longer serial interval has very little
impact on the weekly forecasts produced, it results in much higher
estimates of transmissibility.

    x = c(0:30, 0:30),

## Projections and $R_t$ estimates {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills} 

### Ensemble Model {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills} 

#### Methods

This is an unweighted ensemble of Models 1, 2 and 3. We obtained
posterior distribution for all estimated reproduction numbers and
forecasted deaths by simply combining the posterior distributions of
each model.

Ensemble models, even if built with a relatively simple approach such
as adopted here, have been shown to typically
perform better than individual models in the context of epidemiology
of infectious diseases [@viboud2018rapidd].


#### Projections

**Current and past forecasts**

*Caution note*: We note that in France, a large increase 
in deaths was reported towards the end of the week starting 30-03-2020. This 
is largely due to back-reporting of deaths outside hospital settings, 
and therefore, this is likely to have inflated the estimates
$R_t$. The forecasts of deaths for the coming week are thefore likely
to be over-estimated.

### Model 1 {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills} 

#### Methods

The approach, similar to model 2, was to estimate the current
reproduction number (the average number of secondary cases generated
by a typical infected individual, $R_t$) and to use that to forecast
future incidence of death. The current reproduction number was
estimated assuming constant transmissibility during a chosen
time-window (i.e. one week).


**Estimating current transmissibility**

Here we relied on a well-established and simple method
[@nouvellet2018simple] that assumed the daily incidence, I~t~ (here
representing deaths), could be approximated with a Poisson process
following the renewal equation [@fraser2007estimating]:

$$I_t \sim Pois\left( R_t \sum_{s=0}^tI_{t-s}w_s\right)$$

where $R_t$ is the instantaneous reproduction number and $w$ is the
serial interval distribution. From this a likelihood of the data given
a set of model parameters can be calculated, as well the posterior
distribution of $R_t$ given previous observations of incidence and
knowledge of the serial interval [@cori2013new]. 


We used this approach to estimate $R_t$ over three alternative
time-windows defined by assuming a constant $R_t$ for either the 2, 3
or 4 weeks prior to the most recent data-point. We made no assumptions
regarding the epidemiological situation and transmissibility prior to
each time-window. Therefore, no data prior to the time-window were
used to estimate $R_t$, and instead we jointly estimated $R_t$ as well as
back-calculated the incidence before the time-window. Specifically, we
jointly estimated the $R_t$ and the incidence level 100 days before the
time-widow. Past incidence was then calculated using the known
relationship between the serial interval, growth rate and reproduction
number. The joint posterior distribution of $R_t$ and the early
epidemic curve (from which forecasts will be generated) were inferred
using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling.


The model has
the advantage of being robust to changes in reporting before the
time-window used for inference.

**Forward projections**

We used the renewal equation [@fraser2007estimating] to project the incidence
forward, given a back-calculated early incidence curve, an estimated
reproduction number, and the observed incidence over the calibration
period. We sampled sets of back-calculated early incidence curves
and reproduction numbers from the posterior distribution obtained in
the estimation process. For each of these sets, we simulated
stochastic realisations of the renewal equation from the end of the
calibration period leading to projected incidence trajectories. 


Projections were made on a 7-day horizon. 
The transmissibility is assumed to remain constant over this time
period. 
If transmissibility were to decrease as a result of control interventions
and/or changes in behaviour over this time period, we would predict 
fewer deaths; similarly, if transmissibility were to increase
over this time period, we would predict more deaths We
limited our projection to 7 days only as assuming constant
transmissibility over longer time horizons seemed unrealistic in light
of the different interventions implemented by different countries and
potential voluntary behaviour changes.


 
#### Projections 

**Current and past forecasts**

*Caution note*: We note that in France, a large increase 
in deaths was reported towards the end of the week starting 30-03-2020. This 
is largely due to back-reporting of deaths outside hospital settings, 
and therefore, this is likely to have inflated the estimates
$R_t$. The forecasts of deaths for the coming week are thefore likely
to be over-estimated.

### Model 2 {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills} 

#### Methods

**Estimating current transmissibility**

The standard approach to inferring the effective reproduction number at
$t$, $R_t$, from an incidence curve (with cases at t denoted I~t~) is
provided by [@cori2013new]. This method assumes that
$R_t$ is constant over a window back in time of size *k* units (e.g. days
or weeks) and uses the part of the incidence curve contained in this
window to estimate $R_t$. However, estimates of $R_t$ can depend strongly on
the width of the time-window used for estimation. Thus
mis-specified time-windows can bias our inference. In [@parag2019optimising]
we use information theory to extend the approach of Cori et al. to optimise
the choice of the time-window and refine estimates of $R_t$. 
Specifically:

-   We integrate over the entire posterior distribution of $R_t$, to
    obtain the posterior predictive distribution of incidence at time
    t+1 as P(I~t+1~ \| I~1~^t^) with I~1~^t^ as the incidence curve up
    to t. For a gamma posterior distribution over $R_t$ this is analytic and negative
    binomial ([see @parag2019optimising] for exact formulae). 
	
-   We compute this distribution sequentially and causally across the
    existing incidence curve and then evaluate every observed case-count
    according to this posterior predictive distribution. For example at
    t = 5, we pick the true incidence value I~5~\* and evaluate the
    probability of seeing this value under the predictive distribution
    i.e. P(I~5~ = I~5~\* \| I~1~^4^).

This allows us to construct the accumulated predictive error (APE) under
some window length *k* and under a given generation time distribution
as:

$$\text{AP}E_{k} = \sum_{t = 0}^{T - 1}{- \log{P\left( I_{t + 1} = I_{t + 1}^{*}\  \right|\ I_{t - k + 1}^{t})\ \ }}$$

The optimal window length *k\** is then
$k^{*} = \arg{\min_{k}{\text{AP}E_{k}}}$.  Here
*T* is the last time point in the existing incidence curve.

**Forward Projections**

Forward projections are made assuming that the transmissibility
remains unchanged over the projection horizon and same as the transmissibility
in the last time-window.  The projections are made using the standard
branching process model using a Poisson offspring distribution. 




#### Projections

**Current and past forecasts**

*Caution note*: We note that in France, a large increase 
in deaths was reported towards the end of the week starting 30-03-2020. This 
is largely due to back-reporting of deaths outside hospital settings, 
and therefore, this is likely to have inflated the estimates
$R_t$. The forecasts of deaths for the coming week are thefore likely
to be over-estimated.

deaths  to reported cases (with a 10-day delay) using a moving window
of 7 days.

deaths to reported cases 10 days prior (medians and 95% CIs, solid
lines and bands respectively).
Also plotted are the reported deaths (red dots) and reported cases
(black dots). 
The reported number of deaths and cases have
been re-scaled so
that the maximum recorded numbers of deaths or cases (with a 10-day
delay) reaches 1.

*Note that if deaths exceed the number of reported cases 10 days
before, we set the ratio at 1 (95% CI 1-1)*

### Estimating ascertainment



**Table 4**: Results summary for reporting and case ascertainment. We present 
(**i**) the estimated ratio of deaths to reported cases 10 days prior per country
  (mean and 95% CI) during the last *14 days*; (**ii**) the estimated
  case ascertainment per country (mean and 95% CI) during the last *14
  days*; (**iii**) the estimated factor to be multiplied by observed
  number of cases to obtain
  the true number of cases (scaling factor x observed cases). Mean and
  95% CI, estimated for the last *14 days*; (**iv**) the observed and
  predicted number of cases in the *last week* (week starting
  22-03-2020). Estimates for the number of deaths have been rounded to 
  3 significant figures. Estimated case ascertainment, factors to real
  size and predicted true number of cases assume perfect reporting of
  deaths.
