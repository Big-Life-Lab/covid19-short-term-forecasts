### Methods

*Objectives*

* Estimate trends in case ascertainment and the ratio of deaths to
  reported cases.
* Use these to estimate the true size of the epidemic.

*Assumptions*

We assume 

* that deaths due to COVID-19 are perfectly reported;
* a known distribution for delay from report to death (Gamma
  distribution with mean 10 days and standard deviation 2 days); and,
* a known distribution for CFR [@verity2020].


Let $D_{i, t}$ be the number of deaths in location $i$ at time $t$.
Let $I_{i, t}^r$ be the reported number of cases in location $i$ at
time $t$ and $I_{i, t}^{true}$ be the true number of cases.
We assume that the reporting to death delay $\delta$ is distributed
according to a Gamma distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard
deviation $\sigma$. That is,

\[\delta \sim \Gamma(\mu, \sigma).\]

Let $r_{i, t}$ be the ratio of deaths to reported cases in location
$i$ at time $t$. We assume that deaths are distributed according to
a Binomial distribution thus:
\[
D_{i, t} \sim Binom\left( \int\limits_0^{\infty}{\Gamma(x \mid \mu,
\sigma)I_{i, t - x}^{r}dx} , r_{i, \mu}\right).
\]

This allows us to obtain a posterior distribution for $r_{i, t}$.

Case ascertainment is defined as:

\[ \rho_{i, t} = \frac{CFR}{r_{i, t}}.\]

Thus a posterior distribution for $\rho_{i, t}$ can be obtained using
the posterior distribution for $r_{i, t}$ and the posterior distribution
for CFR.

Combining the CFR and the case ascertainment, we can estimate the true
number of cases in the epidemic at any point. 

For the period over which we have information on deaths i.e., up to
time $t - \mu$, we use the posterior distribution of
CFR to obtain $I_{i, t}^{true}$. The true number of cases in a
location $i$ at time $t$ is the sum cases that did not die and the
number of deaths. 
\[
I_{i, t}^{true} \sim D_{i, t - \mu} + NBin(D_{i, t - \mu}, CFR).
\]

For the period over which we do not have information on deaths i.e.,
after time $t - \mu$, we use
the posterior distribution of case ascertainment to obtain

\[
I_{i, t}^{true} \sim I_{i, t}^{r} + NBin(I_{i, t}^{r}, \rho_{i,
t}).
\]
