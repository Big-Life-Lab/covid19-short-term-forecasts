Overview

The objective of this project is to forecast for the daily number of
COVID-19 cases in countries with sustained local transmission. We will
produce forecasts for the week starting Monday every Monday at noon
(London time). The forecasts will be produced by three teams and a
centralised team will also produce ensemble forecasts.


Workflow

- A centralised team will make available cleaned data for all
  countries that have at least 100 cases of COVID-19, and at least
  10 cases in the last week. Note that this means the number of
  countries for which forecasts are produced could vary every
  week. The data will be available in the github repo by Friday 5 PM.
- Each team them produces forecasts of daily incidence, and estimates
  of effective reproduction number and makes them available in a
  standard format (to be specified).
- The centralised team (Pierre and Sangeeta) then feed these into
  visualisations. They also use agreed upon model averaging methods to
  produce ensemble forecasts that also feed into visualisation.
